        One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
        over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching
        the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their
        names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by
        trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest
        in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
        millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
        without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
